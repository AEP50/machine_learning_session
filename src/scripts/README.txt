Please run Estimation_MNL.R and estimation_MNL_increased_tran_Access.R before running any jupyter notebook scripts
Please uncomment the install.packages chunk in R scripts if the machine does not have the packages installed
Both R and Python scripts will output a bunch of PNR and csv files. These files were used in the paper. 


estimation_MNL.R: Script to estimate and apply the MNL model with uniform and biased sample
estimation_MNL_increased_tran_Access.R: Script to estimate the MNL model, and test the transit accessibility scenario

auto_ownership_ML.ipynb: Script to estimate various ML models and compare with the MNL results
auto_ownership_ML_elasticity.ipynb: Script to test the elasticity of various models
